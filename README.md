 •	Abstract
This project assesses the performance of various digital advertising campaigns to identify optimal strategies for a digital marketing department. By analyzing key performance indicators such as revenue, costs, and return on investment (ROI), we derive insights into which campaigns deliver the highest returns. This analysis offers actionable recommendations to enhance advertising expenditures and improve overall campaign effectiveness. The insights will empower the digital marketing team to make informed, data-driven decisions, maximizing both impact and budget efficiency.
•	Introduction
In today’s digital marketing environment, understanding the effectiveness of advertising campaigns is vital for strategic budget allocation and maximizing ROI. The digital marketing team faces the challenge of discerning which campaigns yield the most substantial outcomes. With numerous campaigns operating across various channels and formats, it can be challenging to pinpoint which ads drive the most revenue and engagement. Inefficient budgeting may lead to missed opportunities or excessive spending on underperforming campaigns. 

This project seeks to tackle these challenges by analyzing a dataset of digital advertising campaigns. The primary objectives include:
1. Identifying campaigns with the highest and lowest revenue.
2. Assessing the correlation between advertising costs and revenue.
3. Determining campaigns with the highest ROI.
By addressing these objectives, we aim to provide insights that enable the digital marketing department to make informed, data-driven decisions to optimize future campaigns and budget allocations.
•	Methodology
    Data Sources
The dataset analyzed comprises detailed information on multiple digital advertising campaigns, covering performance metrics over several months. Key data points include:
- Date Details: Month and day of each ad campaign.
- Campaign ID: Unique identifier for each campaign.
- User Engagement: Level of user engagement (e.g., High, Low).
- Banner Dimensions: Sizes of the advertising banners.
- Placement: Location of the ad placements.
- Displays: Total ad impressions.
- Cost: Expenditure on each advertisement.
- Clicks: Number of times ads were clicked.
- Revenue: Revenue generated from each ad.
- Post-Click Conversions: Number of conversions following ad clicks.
- Post-Click Sales Amount: Sales resulting from clicks
•	Tools
For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, Microsoft Excel was employed. Excel's functionalities, including pivot tables, charts, and formulas, facilitated a comprehensive evaluation of campaign performance.

•	Methods
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Removed irrelevant columns and addressed missing values.
   - Ensured data format consistency, particularly for dates.
   - Created a new column to calculate profit for assessing ROI.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Descriptive Statistics: Computed metrics such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum for key variables (e.g., revenue, cost, clicks).
   - Campaign Performance Summary: Summarized and compared campaign revenue, costs, and clicks using pivot tables.
   - Correlation Analysis: Developed scatter plots to examine the relationship between costs and revenue.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Created bar charts to illustrate total revenue, costs, and profits for each campaign.
   - Utilized line graphs to track campaign performance over time.
   - Developed an interactive dashboard showcasing key metrics (revenue, cost, ROI) for a comprehensive overview.

•	Results
    Key Findings
1. Revenue Performance: Campaign 1 generated the highest revenue, while Campaign 3 had the lowest. Notably, Campaign 1 also yielded the highest profit.
2. Cost and Revenue Correlation: A moderate positive correlation was found between costs and revenue, suggesting that increased spending typically leads to higher returns, albeit not consistently across all campaigns.
3. Return on Investment (ROI): Campaign 1 exhibited the highest ROI, indicating strong cost-effectiveness, whereas Campaign 3 revealed the lowest ROI, implying a lack of profitability despite its expenditures.
